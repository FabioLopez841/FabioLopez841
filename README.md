<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I'm Fabio</h1>

<p align="center">
  

With a background in **Business Administration**, I bring a strong business-oriented perspective to data analysis—always focused on solving real problems and supporting decision-making with evidence.

I'm also a **father to a one-year-old son**, which drives me every day to grow, learn, and build a meaningful career in the data field. Balancing parenthood and professional development has taught me the value of focus, discipline, and purpose.

  I use tools like <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and <strong>Power BI</strong> to clean, analyze, and visualize data.
  I'm passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights.
